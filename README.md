# karahan-active
The repository karahan-active is used in my workflow for updating my hugo-based website https://karahan.net. 
The contents are edited on my local computer. The public-folder of my hugo installation is synced with this repository. A script on the webserver is looking
for updates in this repository and is updating the webserver-content.
